V0.88 Added Unity and Unity Flat looks to the dock
      Changed the way in which the dock appearance is set in the
      preferences dialog, so that preset 'themes' or a custom mix
      of icon background and indicators can be applied.
      Fix for issue #167 - Unpinned applications do not minimize to their own button
      Fix for issue #166 - MATE's Sticky Notes show up in the Dock

      Fix for issue #101 - Double click needed, if panel not expaned
      Fix for an untracked issue where apps whose .desktop file specified a
      full path and filename for their desktop icon would not load the icon correctly.
      Also closed several historic and no longer relevant issues relating to
      older versions of the applet.

	    Fix for issue #152 - Icons of wine applications aren't displayed
	    Fix for issue #153 - All actions defined in a .desktop file are now
      displayed in the right click or popup menus rather. Previously a maximum
      of 4 only would be displayed.
	    Fix for issue #146 - unable to restore some minimized windows
	    Fix for issue #144 - blurry icons on hidpi displays

      Note : Many thanks go to github user @vkareh for the fixes to issues

V0.86 Fix for issue #130, Icon stays highlighted with all windows closed
      Fix for issue #131 - dock sizing options appearing in the
      preferences dialog when not needed
      Fix for issue #132 - Program activation by dragging doesn't work
	    Fix for issues #136 and #140 - icons for windows which the applet should
      have been ignoring were appearing in the dock.
	    Fix for issue #137 - Telegram icon not found; shows as generic cogs
	    Fix for issue #138 - dragging app icons not always working
      Fix for issue #142 - Certain function keys cause the keyboard listener to
      stop working (thanks to @nschulzke on github for this)
	    Potential fix for issue #144 - Blurry app icons. Untested due to lack of
	    hidpi monitor.
	    Fixed window previews with Compiz which were broken in V0.81
	    When an app's window is closed from the window list, the window list
      is now hidden

V0.85 Contains a workaround for Launchpad bug #1755835 which
      affected Mutineers who switched panel layouts and found
      their dock settings had not been carried forward.

V0.84 The workaround introduced in V0.83 has been adjusted following
      the removal of the workspace swticher applet from the
      Mutiny panel layout

V0.83 Contains a temporary workaround for a mate panel issue
      (https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-panel/issues/745)

      This workaround will be removed when the issue is resolved.

V0.82 With MATE 1.20 app icon scrolling is automatically enabled when it is
      needed - i.e. when the applet runs out of space on the panel to expand
      into - and automatically disabled when not needed e.g. when the applet
      is given more space by being moved, or when another applet it removed
      from the panel. When the applet is moved around the panel, it will now
      also resize larger or smaller to fit into the available space (in the
      same way as the window list applet does) down to a minimum size of
      4 app icons.

      Because of this, the dock size configuration options introduced in
      V0.81 are not needed with Mate 1.20 and do not appear in the
      preferences dialog.

      If this new version of the applet is used with versions of MATE
      < 1.20 it will behave as V0.81 did, auto configuring scrolling
      when the Mutiny panel layout is used, and otherwise allowing the user
      to configure scrolling via the preferences dialog.


V0.81 Removed built in app matching code and replaced it with use of the bamf
      library

      The dock can now scroll app icons. This feature is automatically
      enabled when using the Mutiny layout of Mate Tweak, and
      can also be manually configured by using a new preferences
      item.

      Action lists and window lists no longer steal focus from other windows.

      Solid filled active app backgrounds have been adjusted to provide better
      contrast with the panel.

V0.80 With Gtk3 and Python GObject bindings 3.26.0 or greater, window lists and
      action lists now have rounded corners and point to their app's icon in the
      dock. Fix for Issues #52 and #53

      Fix for Issue #84 - app icons continually flashing

      The delay before action lists appear when the mouse hovers over a dock icon can
      now be set in the preferences dialog

      Apps can now be pinned to specific workspaces, in other words their app icons only
      appear in the dock when a particular workspace is active. This allows users
      to customise the dock for each workspace they use.

      Fix for Issue #87 - the applet right click menu no longer contains
      actions for the currently active app when popup action lists are enabled

      When unpinning an app a notification is now displayed which allows the operation to
      be undone and re-pins the app to the dock.

      The appearance of progress bars on dock icons has been improved.

V0.79 The applet no longer swallows <Super> key presses. This means it now works happily
      alongside other apps that also use the <Super> key, e.g. the Brisk menu, the Advanced
      Mate Menu or Albert.

      Fixed crashes relating to Pango when window list and action_list contents needed
      to be ellipsized.

V0.78 Added five new types of indicators

      Added a new option to specify the amount of space between icons in the dock

      Added a new option to specify how a dock icon reacts when an app requires
      attention. The icon can now either flash (the default) or display an
      exclamation mark over the icon.

V0.77 Extended drag and support in Gtk3 version of the applet:
            Apps can be added to the dock by dragging them off menu applets
            (Main Menu, Menu Bar, Advanced Menu, Brisk Menu) and onto the
            applet (Gtk3 only)
            If data is dragged from an app onto another running app's icon
            the new app will be made active, allowing the dragged data to
            dropped onto it (Gtk3 only)

       Added keyboard shortcuts to select and acticate apps in the dock:
            <Super>1-0 for the first 10 apps in the dock
            <Super><Alt>1-0 for apps 10-20 in the dock

            For the 5th app, it would be necessary to hold down the Super key
            (i.e. the Windows) key and press 5. For the 12th app, it would be necessary
            to hold bown both the Super key and the Alt key and press 2.

            The effect of these shortcuts is as follows:
            If the app is not running, it will be started.
            If the app is running and only has a single window open, the window will
            cycled between minimised and activated states.
            If the app is running and has multiple windows open, each keypress will
            activate and display each window in turn.

      Updated the About window to provide details of the new drag and drop and
      keyboard shortcuut features.

      Fixed a bug which prevented window and action lists from appearing

      New dependencies - keybinder-0.0 (gir1.2-keybinder-0.0 (ubuntu) for gtk2)
                         keybinder-3.0 (gir1.2-keybinder-3.0 (ubuntu) for gtk3)
                         libkeybinder-3.0 (Arch)

V0.76 Added support for startup notification when launching apps.
      Added new indicator type - a single solid bar. On Gtk3 this uses the active
      theme's highlight colour. This is not possible with Gtk2, therefore the
      applet will draw a gray bar, although the user can override this colour
      and choose a new one to fit in with whichever theme they are using
      Added new types of indicators and active icon backgrounds, and reworked code
      so that adding new types in the future will be easier.
      Added new preferences options to allow the select the type of indicator
      and active icon background, along with with a live preview.
      Added a new preference item allowing the user to select a colour to
      use when drawing bar indicators.
      About dialog reworked to be hopefully less ugly....

V0.75 Fixed bug that caused window lists to sometimes span monitors on multi monitor
    systems
    Added Compiz support - the dock can now display window previews (via the Scale and
    DBus plugins) when switching between app windows rather than using the built
    in window list.
    Mouse clicks on an app's dock icon now work differently:
        If the app is not running, or if the Shift key is pressed while clicking, the
        app will be started / a new instance will be started.
        If the app has only 1 window open, the window will be activated.
        If the app has multiple windows open, the window list will be shown or the
        Compiz scale plugin will be activated, as appropriate.
    The configuration option to restore all of app's windows or only the previously
    active one on a mouse click has been removed, and replace with a new one which
    allows to user to select between using the built in window list, or Compiz
    window previews.
    The window list no longer contains app actions, e.g. Pin/Unpin, or e.g. 'New Document'
    for LibreOffice Writer).
    App actions now appear in a separate popup window in the same way that the window
    list used to, by hovering the mouse over the dock icon. The actions are also available
    by right clicking on the app icon and selecting them from the panel popup menu.
    A new configuration option has been added to prevent the popup windows appearing in case
    users want to select actions from the right click menu only.
    GTK3 only - The colour of window lists and action popups now match the panel which
    contains the applet, whether the panel is set to use a colour from the current theme
    or a custom colour.

V0.74  Fix for improved matching of binary packaged apps on Gentoo .
    Amended README.me to include the availability of an overlay for the applet
    on Gentoo.
    Corrected position of window lists on non-expanded panels.
    Fix for window list flickering on bottom aligned panels on MATE Gtk3
    Increased the delay before window lists are shown when the mouse hovers over an
    app icon. It was 0.5 seconds, and is now 1 second.
    Shortened pin/unpin window list text. It now says 'Pin <app name>' rather than
    'Pin <app name> to the dock', and the Unpin text is similarly shortened.
    Fixed a bug that would cause Pin/Unpin actions to act upon previously highlighted app
    icons, rather than the one that is currently highlighted.
    When starting to drag an app icon, the window list is now hidden.
    The applet can now display progress bars and counts on app icons for apps which
    support this e.g. the Ubuntu software updater.

V0.73   Added drag and drop rearranging of dock icons (Gtk3 only). Window list
        reworked and prettified.

V0.72   The applet now works on and can be built for both GTK2 and GTK3 versions of MATE.
    Aside from the changes to layout containers (i.e. GTK2 VBox & HBoxes become GTK3
    Boxes/Grids), underlying differences between the two toolkits meant that the code
    to calculate window minimise positions and window list popup positions had to be
    reworked.

    A GTK2 verison of the applet can be produced by running './configure --prefix=/usr'
    during the build process, while running './configure --prefix=/usr --with-gtk3'
    will produce a Gtk3 version.

V0.71   More improvements to matching apps with their .desktop files. In particular this relates
	to Ubuntu 16.04 and Vivaldi, PlayOnLinux, Aptik, Dia, Tor Browser, Gnome Software, Gnome Disks,
	Bazaar Explorer.
	App icons can now be sourced from the 'hicolor' directory
	The window list now displays the title of the active window in bold and italicised text.
	Removed the options to display pinned apps from all or only the current workspace as these
	were based on a misunderstanding of a feature request. They have been replaced with
	a new option to only show indicators and window list items for windows which are on
	the current workspace and this provides the requested functionality.
	Added a 'Hints and Tips' window accessible from the About dialog as a place to list
	useful keyboard shortcuts etc.

V0.70   Settings from previous instances of the applet are now imported
	silently (previously the user was presented with a dialog asking the
	user if they wanted to import the settings). The change is to prevent
	problems when switching to the Mutiny desktop layout via Mate Tweak in
	Ubuntu Mate 16.04
	When saving custom launchers the ~/.local/share/applications directory
	will be created if it doesn't already exist

v0.69   Added code to allow new instances of apps to be started by middle
	clicking their dock icon (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mate/+bug/1554128)
	Fixed bug that would prevent apps from launching if they were in a
	directory structure which contained a space character e.g.
	~/Downloads/PopCorn Time/
	Fixed bug which associated newly opened windows with incorrect apps
	and which occurred when the wm_class_name of the window was not set.
	Fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mate/+bug/1555324

V0.68	Fix for Launchpad bug 1550392
	(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mate-dock-applet/+bug/1550392)

V0.67   Panel colour changing now occurs smoothly over over 0.5s rather than
	abruptly.
	Big cleanup of git repository!

V0.66	Improved matching of apps with their .desktop files, in particular
	Opera and Chrome
	Dock icons now pulse when a new window is opened for a running app
	Minimize targets are now recalculated when the applet is moved or
	changes panel, so that windows always minimize to the correct place
	on the dock
	Added option to change MATE panel colour according to the current
	desktop wallpaper. (Note: this works for images only, not slideshows,
	gradients, or solid colour backgrounds). The colour can be applied to
	all panels or just the panel containing the dock. The applet now depends
	on the Python Imaging Library and SciPy packages because of this
	change
	Added new preferences to options to both activate panel colour changing
	and to limit it to the dock panel panel only
	Added option to not display indicators under running apps
	Added option to not display in the dock running pinned apps which are
	not on the current workspace
	Using the mouse wheel on a dock icon to scroll through an app's
	windows will now change workspace if the new window is not on the
	current workspace
	Selecting an app's window from the pop-up window list will now change
	workspace if the window is not on the current workspace
	Prefs dialog reworked because of new options added in this version

V0.65	Dock icons now blink when an app needs attention
	Change to window activation code so that the applet works
	with MATE 1.12

V0.64   Fixed bug that would sometimes prevent a window from being focused
	when a dock icon was clicked
	Many changes to Improve detection of .desktop files from running apps
	and linking to dock icons
	Right click options (e.g. 'Open new Window' and Open new incognito
	window with Chrome) are now read from .desktop files and appear on
	the dock icon right click menu
	Custom launchers now set the Type field of the .desktop files they
	create to 'Application' and also set the NoDisplay field to 'true'
	so that the launcher is not displayed in the MATE menu
	Customer launchers now write .desktop files that do not contain spaces
	in the filename, as per the GNOME developer docs
	App icons can now be sourced from ~/.local/share/icons (e.g
	popcorn-time puts its icon here)

V0.63   Removed the tooltip that appears when the mouse hovers over a docked
	app and replaced it with a list of the app's open windows. For
	each window, the list displays the app icon, an indicator showing which
	window is currently active, the window title, and a close icon.
	Clicking the close icon closes the window, clicking anywhere else
	makes the window active.
	Removed the list of app windows from the applet right click menu as
	they are no longer required.
	Changed the way the applet works when a running app's dock icon is
	clicked. This no longer minimizes/maximises all windows, but simply
	activates the app's last active window.
	Using the mouse scroll wheel over a running app's dock icon now
	scrolls through each of the app's open windows, unminimizing them
	and activating them as necessary
	.desktop files located in the user's home directory now take
	precedence over those located elsewhere in the filesystem. This allows
	users to create their own .desktop files (e.g. to customize an app's icon)
	and have them recognized by the applet
	Changed factory service file to explicitly invoke applet with python 3
	The applet now saves its settings in ~/.config/mate_dock_applet.conf
	as well as in dconf. On first being added to a panel, the applet
	checks to see if this file exists and if it does it offers to use this
	configuration. This allows e.g. an easy way to restore the applet
	after an accidental deletion from the panel, and also a way to move
	applet configurations from one computer to another.

V0.62	Fixed app icon drawing on non-composited displays.
	For apps which the applet does not recognise (their names or icons
	are incorrect) added a new right click menu option on the dock
	to create a custom launcher for the app. This displays a dialog
	(like the one for the MATE panel) allowing the app's command line,
	name, and icon to be specified. For user convenience, the applet will
	automatically fill in as many of these details as it can. Once
	the new launcher has been created, the app needs to be closed and
	reopened for it to be recognised by the dock. Typically, this
	option will only be needed for apps which have not been installed
	into the usual locations within the Linux filesystem.
	When an app's windows are minimised by clicking on the app's dock
	icon and then maximised by clicking it again, the app window that
	was previously active is made active again.

V0.61   improved the way in which the windows owned by apps are
	detected
	Fixed the function that calculates the average colour of
	icons (for use when drawing highligts on the dock). It
	works now....
	Fixed launching of Caja on linux mint
	Fixed docked_app.setup_from_wnck so that it passes '/' terminated
	versions of all directories to be searched for .desktop file
	to get_desktop_from_app_info
	Shift-clicking the icon of running applications now opens a new
	window of the app
	Added an option for the dock to only display unpinned apps from the
	current workspace.Pinned apps are always displayed no matter what
	workspace is active so that the user always has quick access to them)

V0.60 - various bugfixes and minor additions including:
	Added an option in the preferences dialog to display multiple
	indicators for each open window an app has. The maximum number
	of indicators has been limited to 4 because on small panels
	(<32 pixels) there just isn't room for any more
	changed the app icon drawing code so that most drawing is
	done off screen and only copied to the panel at the very
	end
	Improved detection of app icons and app windows. In general
	this is a good thing, and in particular it means that the
	applet now works correctly with guvcview on Ubuntu Mate
	15.04
	Fixed a bug on Ubuntu Mate 15.04 where terminals started
	from the applet would have their working directory set
	as / instead of the home directory
	Updated the readme with instructions on how to compile the
	applet from source

V0.59 - initial commit to git.
	Honour panel transparency and background settings
	Pin and unpin apps to the dock
	Rearrange application icons on the dock
	Works when panel is aligned to any side of the screen
	Launch apps by clicking on their icons in the dock
	Minimize/unminimize running app windows by clicking the app's dock
	icon
	Detect changes in the current icon theme and update the dock
	accordinly
	Use an indicator by each app to show when it is running
	Allow the user to specify whether a light or dark indicator is used so
	that it can always be seen no matter what colour the panel is
	Provide an About dialog
